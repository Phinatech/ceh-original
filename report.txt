2. Error Handling:
   - Displays specific error messages for each form field.
   - General error message for failed account creation.

3. Form Submission:
   - Submits the form data to the registerUser function.
   - Navigates to the dashboard upon successful registration.
   - Displays a loading state during form submission.

Components Used:
- React useState for managing form data and errors.
